# BSU Lost and Found Portal System

Good day! We are **Group 7**, and we are proud to present our final project: **The BSU Lost and Found Portal System**, a database-driven platform designed to help students, faculty staff, campus personnel, and visitors report, track, and recover lost belongings within **Batangas State University – Malvar Campus**.

## 📌 Introduction
Losing personal items such as IDs, wallets, gadgets, and other essentials is a common and frustrating issue on campus. Many items remain unclaimed due to the absence of an organized and reliable method for matching lost belongings with their rightful owners.

This project provides a **centralized, accessible, and efficient digital portal** where users can:
- Submit reports of lost or found items
- Browse and search existing posts
- Provide detailed descriptions, photos, dates, and locations
- Communicate with individuals who may have found their belongings

Instead of relying on social media posts or word of mouth, this system streamlines the entire process and ensures organized handling of lost and found cases.

## 🗂️ Database Integration
A key component of this project is the use of a **Database Management System (DBMS)** to securely store all user and item data. This includes item details, dates, locations, and user information such as SR-code, contact number, and email.

The DBMS ensures:
- Secure storage of reports
- Accurate and reliable data retrieval
- Organized tracking of item status and user activity

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create a platform for reporting, searching, and recovering lost and found items within the university.
- Improve campus-wide communication regarding misplaced belongings.
- Promote responsibility, honesty, and cooperation among campus members.

## 📍 Scope and Limitations
The system is designed exclusively for **BatStateU – Malvar Campus** and supports students, faculty, and personnel. Due to a limited four-week development period, some planned features such as OTP verification and window resizing were not implemented.

The system depends on:
- User participation
- Accuracy of submitted descriptions
- Internet connectivity

Advanced features like RFID, GPS tracking, or automated item recognition are not included in this version.

## 🧩 System Features
- Lost/Found item reporting
- Admin verification and approval of posts
- Image upload support
- User dashboard notifications
- Item status tracking (pending/approved/rejected)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **DBMS** (PostgreSQL)
- **UI** (JavaFX)
- **Object Storage** (MinIO for uploading image)
- **Build system** (Apache Maven) 
- **GitHub** for version control

## 📅 Project Timeline
This project followed a structured timeline including planning, system design, UI creation, development, debugging, and documentation.

## 🧪 Conclusion
The **BSU Lost and Found Portal System** offers an organized and accessible solution to a common campus issue. By digitizing the reporting and tracking process, it enhances efficiency and strengthens communication within the community. It supports the university’s values of **service, integrity, excellence, and faith**, and serves as a valuable tool for improving campus life.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Integration of image recognition for better item matching
- Automated notifications and alerts
- UI/UX improvements for accessibility
